MIDI-Interactive Heart Visualization
Overview
This project creates an interactive, MIDI-driven heart visualization using p5.js. The heart's properties such as position, size, color, transparency, and rotation are controlled via MIDI input, providing a dynamic, user-driven experience. Additionally, the background color changes based on MIDI pads, and the heart's size is dynamically adjusted using sound spectrum analysis, responding to bass and mid frequencies of the audio track.

Features
MIDI Controller Support:

Knobs control the heart's position, size, color (RGB), transparency, and rotation.

Pads trigger changes in the background color.

Sound Spectrum Visualization:

The heartâ€™s size dynamically adjusts based on the bass and mid frequencies of the audio being played.

Play/Pause Button: Allows you to control the song playback.

Heart Shape Visualization: A heart shape is drawn and manipulated based on user input and the song's sound.
